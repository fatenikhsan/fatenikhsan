 ## **Hi there ðŸ‘‹**

I am Fatin Hamimah binti Ikhsan, a postgraduate student of Electronic Engineering. My research area includes microwave sensors, antenna design and optimization, antenna material synthesis and material characterization. I am currently using CST Microwave Studio software to design, optimize and analyze microwave sensors and antenna.

## What I have been working on

@work

*Microwave sensor- A complementary split ring resonator(CSRR) for 5G application, simulation using CST software and Matlab coding for mathematical equation
*Antenna models - Antenna simulation for 5G frequency
*Multilayer antenna - using different types of substrate for miniaturization antenna
*Antenna material synthesis using mixing method and solid-state method

@self

*Canva- design poster, graphical measurement setup
*Autodesk Tinkercad- using Tinkercad Codeblock to design 3D models
*Power BI- for data analysis
